Then for each test case, we read the number of words, and create a list of words. We then sort the words in reverse order, i.e. from the largest to the smallest. We also create a dictionary to quickly look up the reversed words. \n\nThen, for each word, if it is the second word (i.e., its index is even), we reverse it. If the reversed word exists in our dictionary, we add it to the list of reverses, and remove it from our dictionary. We also increment the count of reversed words. Finally, we print the number of reversed words, and the list of their indexes. If there are no reversed words, we print -1.

The problem requires understanding of real-time calculation and problem-solving skills. The main challenge is to devise an efficient and optimal strategy that minimizes the time required to solve each problem, while maximizing the total score gained.\n\nThe algorithm would need to consider the training phase, where Polycarp's skill level decreases, but only after solving a problem, but it seems there is a minor mistake in the problem statement. The initial training time in each problem ($a_i/s$) would not always reflect the total training time, particularly if Polycarp decides to train before solving one problem.\n\nThe key is to find the maximum score among all possible training times that don't exceed the total contest time. This is done by solving each problem independently while keeping track of the current total score and training time.\n\nTo resolve the issue mentioned in the problem, the initial training time ($a_i/s$) could be calculated based on the time remaining for the contest ($T-t$), while also taking into account the training efficiency ($10-C*t$).

The while loop iterates through the boxes, decreasing the size of the bag until the bag size is zero or the size of the largest box that can be divided is larger than the remaining bag size. If the bag size reaches zero, the function returns the current number of divisions plus one (since the loop already counts the largest box).

The time complexity should be linear, i.e. O(log(n)).\n\nThe following is a python code implementing this solution:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def minimumOneBitOperations(self, n: int) -> int:\n        if n == 0:\n            return 0\n        else:\n            bits = 1.0\n            operations = 0.0\n            while n > 0:\n                if n % 2 == 1:\n                    operations += bits\n                bits *= 2\n                n = n // 2\n            return int(operations)\n```\n\nThis code works by calculating the total operations to transform the last bit. It then takes the rest of the bits and adds them to the operations (since each new bit starts with 2^i operations, where i is the position of the bit in the binary representation), thus adjusting for any additional 1 bits at the end. Note that the last bit is already processed, so we use the total operations to calculate the remaining bits. This approach has a time complexity of O(log n) because it only needs to iterate through each bit in the number once.\n", ""], "138": ["from typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def getMaxLen(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        pos, neg = [0]*2\n        max_len = 0\n\n        for i in range(len(nums)):\n            if nums[i] > 0:\n                pos[0] += 1\n                if pos[1] > 0:\n                    pos[1] += 1\n            elif nums[i] < 0:\n                neg[0] += 1\n                if neg[1] > 0:\n                    neg[1] += 1\n            else:\n                pos = [0, 0]\n                neg = [0, 0]\n\n            max_len = max(max_len, pos[0] + neg[1])\n\n        return max_len\n", ""], "139": ["class Solution:\n    def minDeletionSize(self, A: List[str]) -> int:\n        return sum(A[i] > A[i+1] for i in range(len(A)-1))\n", ""], "140": ["Sure, the problem is asking for the maximum XOR in a list of numbers.

Here is how you can implement it:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestWPI(self, hours: List[int]) -> int:\n        work_hours = [1 if hour > 8 else 0 for hour in hours]\n        prefix_sum = [0] * len(work_hours)\n        prefix_sum[0] = work_hours[0]\n        \n        for i in range(1, len(work_hours)):\n            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + work_hours[i]\n        \n        counter = 0\n        for i in range(len(prefix_sum)):\n            if prefix_sum[i] > counter:\n                counter = prefix_sum[i]\n        \n        longest_interval = 0\n        for i in range(len(prefix_sum)):\n            for j in range(i + longest_interval, len(prefix_sum)):\n                if prefix_sum[j] - (i > 0 ? prefix_sum[i - 1] : 0) > counter and j - i > longest_interval:\n                    longest_interval = j - i\n                    \n        return longest_interval\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThis solution works by first creating a list `work_hours` where 1's indicate work hours and 0's indicate non-work hours. We initialize `prefix_sum` with same size as `work_hours` and fill it by summing the `work_hours` array from the beginning to the current index. We then iterate over `prefix_sum` to find the maximum value in it which indicates the longest well-performing interval. If we want to check all possible subarrays, we may need to sort `work_hours` in ascending order and then use two pointers to find the longest well-performing interval.

The goal is to find a magic square within a given grid, where a magic square is a 3x3 matrix that contains a set of distinct numbers where the sum of numbers in each row, each column, and both diagonals are the same. This problem is NP-hard, meaning that there are no efficient solutions to the problem. The 3x3 magic square problem is NP-hard, meaning that no efficient solution can be found within polynomial time, i.e., no faster time than O(n^3) for a given problem.\n\nFor this problem, we can use Depth-First Search to explore all sub-grids of size 3x3 and count how many of them are magic square. To do this, we can iterate through all starting positions, and then for each of those positions, we can create a 3x3 magic square from that starting position to the bottom right corner of the grid. Then we check if this magic square is a magic square by checking if the sum of each row, column, and diagonal is the same.

We also update `left_sum` by adding the current machine's value.

The reason for this is because if we add a duplicate character to the string, it will not contribute to the final result.\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxLength(self, arr: List[str]) -> int:\n        self.max_len = 0\n        self.dfs(arr, [])\n        return self.max_len\n\n    def dfs(self, arr, path):\n        # Base case\n        if len(path) > self.max_len:\n            self.max_len = len(path)\n        \n        for s in arr:\n            # Check if it's not duplicated and is a valid string\n            if len(set(s)) < len(s) and s not in path:\n                # Add it to the current path\n                path.append(s)\n                # Continue with the next level of depth\n                self.dfs(arr, path)\n                # Backtrack to remove the current string from the path\n                path.pop()\n```\n\nThis algorithm works by generating all possible strings by adding each string to the path, and checking if it contains duplicates and if it is a valid string (does not contain any duplicates and is not already in the path). If it is valid, it is added to the path and the function continues to generate all possible strings. If it is not valid, it is ignored and the function goes back to generate other strings.\n\nThe base case is the case where the path length is greater than the maximum length found so far. If the path length is greater, it updates the maximum length. Then it iterates through each string in the input array and checks if it is a valid string to be added to the path. It adds the string to the path and continues the process. After adding the string to the path, it checks if the maximum length is still the same. If it is, it backtracks by removing the string from the path and continues with the next level of depth. It does this until all strings in the array have been visited.\n\nThis algorithm works with a time complexity of O(2^n), where n is", ""], "265": ["```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxNonOverlapping(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n        pre_sum = {0: -1}\n        cur_sum = 0\n        count = 0\n        for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n            cur_sum += num\n            if cur_sum - target in pre_sum:\n                count += 1\n                cur_sum = num\n                pre_sum.pop(cur_sum - target)\n            else:\n                pre_sum[cur_sum] = i\n        if cur_sum != target:\n            pre_sum.pop(cur_sum)\n        return count\n```\n", ""], "266": ["To solve this problem, we can use two pointers and hash map in Python.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def numSplits(self, s: str) -> int:\n        left = [0]*26\n        right = [0]*26\n        unique_letters = set()\n        for ch in s:\n            unique_letters.add(ch)\n            right[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1\n        \n        ans = 0\n        for ch in unique_letters:\n            left[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1\n            right[ord(ch) - ord('a')] -= 1\n            if right[ord(ch) - ord('a')] == 0:\n                del right[ord(ch) - ord('a')]\n            ans += left[ord(ch) - ord('a')] > 0 and right[ord(ch) - ord('a')] > 0\n        \n        return ans\n```\nExplanation:\nIn this solution, we maintain two counters: left and right.

The main idea here is to generate all permutations and keep track of the current sequence. We can generate the next permutation using a recursive function backtrack(). For each level, the number of permutations for this level is equal to the factorial of (n - number of levels left - 1). This is because the factorial gives us the total number of permutations for all levels to the current level. For each level, we iterate through all numbers starting from the start and append it to the sequence if the next permutation is not already in the sequence.\n\nIn Python, you can get the factorial of n with the given solution.

We do this for both sides. At the end, we return the sum of all the minimum values in the \"left\" and \"right\" lists. This works because if a child has more candies than their neighbor (i.e. rating[i] > rating[i-1]), we must give more candies to them than their left neighbor.

Otherwise, it sorts the pairs and iterates over the sorted pairs, keeping track of how many pairs in both `s1` and `s2` end up in the same order in `s1` and `s2`. Finally, it adds the number of pairs in `s1` and `s2` that end up in the same order to the total and divides the total by 2 to account for the swaps that need to occur between the remaining unpaired pairs in `s1` and `s2`, and finally divides the total by 2 again to account for the swaps that need to occur between the remaining unpaired pairs in `s1` and `s2`.

The final answer is at position `n%2`.\n\nRemember, when calculating `ans[i%2] = (ans[i%2] + s[i])%mod`, you need to take care that `i > 1`, and `ans[i%2] = (ans[i%2] + 2*s[i-1] - s[i-2])%mod` should be `ans[i%2] = (ans[i%2] + 2*s[i-1] - s[i-2])%mod`, not `ans[", ""], "366": ["```python\nimport collections\n\nclass Solution:\n    def longestSubstring(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:\n        left, right = 0, 0\n        counter = collections.Counter()\n        for right in range(len(s)):\n            counter[s[right]] += 1\n            if counter[s[right]] == k:\n                counter.pop(s[left])\n                left += 1\n        return right - left + 1\n```\nExplanation: \nIn this solution, the sliding window is used to check the longest substring that contains at least k occurrences of each character in the string s. We maintain two pointers `left` and `right`, where `right` is the rightmost pointer in the current window and `left` is the leftmost pointer in the current window. \n\nWe increment `right` until we have more than `k` occurrences of a character. If we have less than `k` occurrences, we pop the leftmost character from the counter and increment `left`.\n\nThe longest length of the current window is `right - left + 1`. \n\nThis method works because if the current window contains at least `k` occurrences of each character, then the longest substring within this window is also the longest substring with at least `k` occurrences of each character.\n\nThis method is used to improve the time complexity from O(n^2) to O(n).\n", ""], "367": ["I'm sorry, but the code in your question seems to have some confusion. The problem statement is asking for finding a duplicate in a list of numbers, but the statement also mentions that there can be more than one duplicate. However, the problem doesn't actually specify that we need to return the duplicate in a particular index, or that we don't have to use the index.\n\nIf by \"index\", you mean that it should return the duplicate number in the first occurrence of the duplicate number, the problem can be solved by using a slow and fast pointer approach, also known as the tortoise and the hare approach. Here's a sample python implementation of the approach:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        tortoise = hare = nums[0]\n        while True:\n            tortoise = nums[tortoise]\n            hare = nums[nums[hare]]\n            if tortoise == hare:\n                break\n\n        tortoise = nums[0]\n        while tortoise != hare:\n            tortoise = nums[tortoise]\n            hare = nums[hare]\n            \n        return hare\n```\n\nIn this implementation, the tortoise and the hare are moving through the array. The tortoise moves one step at a time while the hare moves two steps at a time. When they meet, this indicates that there is a duplicate number in the array. We then detect the start of the cycle by moving the tortoise back to the starting point and continue the hare at the same pace.\n", ""], "368": ["Sure, here is a Python solution using the call-based format.

This is because we want to maximize the total sum as we try to prepare as many dishes as possible.\n\nStep 2: \nInitializing the variable max_coefficient to 0. This will hold the maximum sum of the Like-time coefficient.\n\nStep 3: \nInitializing the variable coeff to 0. This will hold the sum of the Like-time coefficient for each dish from the beginning of the list.\n\nStep 4:\nThen we start from the beginning of the list and for each item, add the current dish's time to coeff and multiply it by the current item's value. If the current dish's time is greater than the previous dish, it means we can exclude the previous dish, so we update coeff with 0. After adding the dish's time to coeff, if the sum of the coefficient is greater than max_coefficient, we update max_coefficient.\n\nStep 5: \nFinally we return max_coefficient.\n```\n\nHere is the Python code implementing this concept:\n\n```python\ndef maxSatisfaction(self, satisfaction: List[int]) -> int:\n    satisfaction.sort(reverse=True)\n    max_coefficient = 0\n    coeff = 0\n    for i in range(len(satisfaction)):\n        coeff += satisfaction[i] * (i + 1)\n        if coeff > max_coefficient:\n            max_coefficient = coeff\n        if satisfaction[i] >= satisfaction[i - 1]:\n            coeff = 0\n    return max_coefficient\n```\nThis solution uses the call-based method and has a time complexity of O(n log n) for the sort operation, where n is the length of the input list.

If they are not equal, then the number is not a palindrome.\n\nBut even with these checks, we still need to make sure that the number is a prime number.

We can keep track of the valid k values by keeping a prefix sum of the maximum sweetness of the chocolates in the remaining part of the box. The prefix sum is the maximum sweetness obtained by eating chocolates so far and including the current chocolate.

Firstly, we sort the buttons that are of white type (C1, C2, ..., CK) in ascending order. Then, we sort the buttons that are of black type (D1, D2, ..., DM) in descending order. \n\nAfter that, we make a dynamic programming table. The DP[i] represents the maximum sum that can be obtained if we have done i tasks. We initialize DP[0] to be 0 because we haven't done any tasks.\n\nThe dynamic programming process is as follows:\n\n1. For each button of the white type, we calculate the maximum sum of tasks that can be obtained, then we take the maximum of them. \n\n2. For each button of the black type, we calculate the maximum sum of tasks that can be obtained, and subtract this from the DP[i], where i is the number of tasks done so far. The reason for this is that when we take this button, we are effectively reducing the number of remaining tasks by x. \n\n3. Finally, we return the DP[N] as the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks. \n\nThis dynamic programming solution is quite efficient, as it only needs to process each button type once, and the time complexity is O(N), which is acceptable for the given constraints.\n\nPlease note that the above solution assumes that the tasks are given in increasing order on the buttons, and that the buttons are also given in increasing order.

For each possible duration, we will create a pattern of the days Chef spends his time. This could be achieved by enumerating all the days of the week. We will then check if the pattern fits the given constraints ($L$ <= duration <= $R$). \n\nIf a pattern fits the constraints, we save it and continue to other patterns. If it doesn't, we discard it. This process will be repeated until all the possibilities are checked. \n\nThe complexity of this solution will be O($L$), as we generate all possible durations from $L$ to $R$. This solution is not feasible for large $T$ (more than 10,000) and $L$ (more than 100).

This principle is useful when we try to find the number of pairs of ants that meet.\n\nThe basic approach is to count the number of each type of ant first, then for each ant type, calculate how many pairs of ants of that type have been found. For instance, if there are three ants of type 'U', we first count the number of pairs in which one ant is 'U' and another ant is an 'D', because the ant is moving up, and an ant is moving down.

It then counts the number of each type of ant in the grid. For each type of ant, it calculates the number of pairs of ants of that type that have been found, and adds this to the total count. Finally, it prints the total count, which is the number of pairs of ants that meet each other.\n\nThe complexity of this program is O(R*C), as it needs to iterate through each cell of the grid once.

The height of each plant increases by an integer value at each hour. The task is to determine the minimum number of integer hours Chef must wait before two plants with the same height are adjacent.\n\nThe problem involves sorting the heights of the plants, and then identifying the height groups. The first step in this process is to sort the array in decreasing order, which is the key to solve this problem. This step will ensure that the plant with the largest height is always at the front of the array, and the plant with the second largest height is always at the next position.\n\nThis process can be efficiently performed by a greedy approach. Begin by placing a pointer at the end of the array. This pointer should always point to the plant with the second largest height. Keep moving this pointer backwards through the array and increment a counter each time it steps. This counter represents the number of minutes until a plant of the same height as the current plant can be grown again. If the current plant's height is the same as the plant at the current position, increase the counter by one.\n\nAfter the counter reaches zero, replace the plant at the current position with a placeholder plant of a height that is greater than the current plant's height. The placeholder plant's height is equal to the current plant's height, and the height of the placeholder plant is less than the height of the plant at the current position.\n\nThis process continues until the pointer points to an index where the plant height is different from the plant at the current position, meaning a plant of the same height can be grown in that time.\n\nAfter this process, the pointer will point to the plant at the end of the array, which represents the plant with the largest height.\n\nThis algorithm achieves the minimum number of integer hours Chef must wait before two plants of the same height can be grown in one go, in a time complexity of O(N), where N is the number of plants.\n\nNote: The exact solution requires the use of algorithms and data structures suitable for large inputs, such as sorting algorithms and sliding window techniques.\n", ""], "1019": ["It seems like you have forgotten to write a python code to solve the problem.

The `for` loop in the `all` function checks the condition of being equal to the part number to its left (`h[i-1]`) and to its right (`h[i]`).

Hence, it's easy to find half of February's 28 days. But half of a non-leap year is not possible, so for February, we cannot know if it's a leap year or not.\n- In January to December, half of February's 28 days is always 12 days, which is the same as the full 28 days.\n- Hence, to find the half of a specific day or month, it's sufficient to find the number of days that the total number of days divided by 2 leaves rest, that is, the number of days that the total number of months divided by 2 leaves rest.\n\nFor example, to find half of January (January has 1 day, January has 14 days in total, so 14/2 = 7):\n- 1 January has 14 days, 14/2 = 7 days, so the day of the half birthday is 8 (as 8 is the number of days before the 1st day of the month, and 1 month after the half birthday).\n- January (the month of the half birthday) will be the 8th day of the next year, which is the second day of 2022.\n\nSo the code below can be used to find the day of the half birthday, given the birth dates.\n\nPython code to find half birthday:\n\n```python\ndef find_half_birthday(day, month):\n    day_of_month = int(day)\n    month_index = list(map(lambda x: x.lower().count('january'), month)).index(1)\n    total_days", ""], "1166": ["The problem is basically asking for the number of subarrays Ai, Ai+1, ..., Aj such that foo returns K when it is applied to the subarray. \n\nThe constraints given in the problem are somewhat confusing.

It first creates an array `vowels` containing the lowercase vowels. Then, it reverses the string `s`. Next, it creates an empty array `result` to store the final string. It also creates a counter `count`. \n\nThen it loops through each character in the reversed string `s`. If the character is a vowel, it adds a '.' before it if the `count` is equal to 0. Then, it adds the character to `result` and increments `count`. If the character is not a vowel, it adds a '.' before it if `count` is equal to 1. Then, it converts the character to lowercase and adds it to `result`.\n\nFinally, it reverses the array `result` and joins all its elements to a string.\n\nFor example, if the input is \"CodeString\", the function will return \".c.d.S.p.r.N.t\" as output.

We are looking for x.\n\nHere, a and b can be any two numbers from 1 to n, but a must be less than or equal to n because a*pow(b, -1) mod k must be less than or equal to n.\n\nSo, if we can find a valid x, it means that there exists one number a that, when multiplied by x, leaves all remainders are zero when divided by n, which is equivalent to saying that x is a solution modulo n.\n\nHere, however, you mentioned that we need to find all solutions.

We then slide our window one character at a time and check if it matches the character in $R$ at the same position. If it does, we slide one step to the right.

We can iterate over all bases from 2 up to the square root of the number (as a larger base would be a multiple of some smaller base) and count how many bases satisfy this condition. \n\nHere is a Python solution based on this approach:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef solve():\n    T = int(input().strip())\n    for _ in range(T):\n        N = int(input().strip())\n        min_base = float('inf')\n        for b in range(2, int(math.sqrt(N)) + 1):\n            if N % b == 0:\n                if check(N, b):\n                    min_base = min(min_base, b)\n        if min_base == float('inf'):\n            print('INFINITY')\n        else:\n            print(min_base)\n\ndef check(n, b):\n    while n:\n        n, remainder = divmod(n, b)\n        if remainder == 1 and n != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nIn the above code, `check` function checks if the base-b representation of the number `n` starts with a 1. It does this by repeatedly dividing `n` by `b` and checking if the remainder is 1. If the remainder is 1, it means that the base-b representation of `n` does not start with a 1, so we return `False`. If it never returns `False`, then `n` is a valid base-b representation of `n`, so we return `True`. We then call `check` for each possible base between 2 and the square root of `n`, and keep track of the smallest base for which the `check` function returns `True`. If there is no such base, we output `INF", ""], "1249": ["This problem requires a deep understanding of combinatorial problems and algorithms, specifically backtracking. Here's how we can approach this problem:\n\nSince we need to find a permutation that makes the function f(P) equal to K, it means we need to maximize f(P) and to maximize P[i] among i <= N-1. \n\nLet's define a permutation P = (p1, p2, ..., pN). We know that p2, p3, ..., pN are the maximum numbers among p1, p2, ..., pN-1. This is because P[i+1] must be at least p1 because P[0] is the maximum.\n\nWe can formulate the problem in the following steps:\n\n1. First, we start by constructing P = (p1, p2, ..., pN), where p1 = N and p2 = N-1, ..., pN = 2, p2 = N - (N-1) + 1.\n2. After this, we iterate over the permutation from i = N-1 to 1, ensuring p[i] >= p[i+1] for each i.\n3. If after all these steps we cannot construct a permutation with f(P) = K, then we need to backtrack.

For each test case, it first reads the length of the necklace. \n\nThen, it initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` is the number of all distinct necklaces of length `i`. It starts with `dp[0] = 1` since there's 1 possible necklace of length 0. For each length `i` from 1 to `n`, `dp[i]` is twice the sum of `dp[i-1]` and `dp[i-2]`. If `i` is more than 1, it also adds the number of necklaces of length `i-2` (since we can't take two of the same type of diamond or platinum). \n\nFinally, it prints `dp[n]`, which is the number of all distinct necklaces of length `n`.

We can iterate over all possible combinations of candies to give out. For each combination, we first calculate the number of candies Sushma gets with the current combination.

For example, if n is 81, the sequence will start as 81, 72, 63, 54, 45, 36, 27, 18, 9. These sequences will eventually end with 0 or n's last two digits. This is because adding 9 to every ten digits (27 in 18, 36 in 27, 45 in 36, and so on) will add 9 to the next digit, and we know that no two digits after the last two digits of a number can be the same.\n\nSo, we need to find the largest possible value of n. However, the problem is not clear how to calculate it. We need to compute the numbers ending in 0 or n's last two digits, which are just the last two digits of n multiplied by 10 and plus the two digits less than the last two digits of n.\n\nThe key insight is the digit d in the last two digits of n is less than 9.

The goal is to save the passengers while minimizing the number of balloons taken. This means minimizing the total color mix and reducing the risk.\n\nLet's look at this from a mathematical perspective:\n\nThe \"balloons\" are represented by integers R, G, and B. Let's denote each balloon as a binary vector of length 3 [R, G, B].\n\nThe color mix is represented as a binary scalar. In the i-th bit, it denotes the i-th color of the balloon. Therefore, the color mix is an integer that consists of bits in the range [0, 2^3]. For instance, if the color mix is 11 (binary: 1011 in base 2) then it means the third balloon is green, and the fourth balloon is blue.\n\nNow, Chef wants to find the \"minimum\" number of balloons he needs to fetch. This means he wants to find the maximum number of different balls he can have. The maximum number of different balls in a color is given by 2^color. Therefore, if he has multiple balls of the same color, he can have at least K * 2^color different balls.\n\nLet's denote K as k.

In other words, the total color mix he should take out is equal to (color mix + 2^color - 1).\n\nFor this to be possible, the balloons should not only have at least one of each color, but also should be as close as possible to having at least K * 2^color different balls (chef wants to have at least k * 2^color different balls in a color).\n\nSo, the minimum number of balloons that Chef needs to take out is equal to the minimum number of balloons in the color mix", ""], "1405": ["This is a problem of combinatorics and number theory.\n\nThe key insight is that for a level $L$, the number of sabotages at level $L$ equals the number of coprime pairs of the form $(i, N//i)$ for $1 \u2264 i \u2264 N$.\n\nLet's understand this step by step. Each sabotage needs to be assigned a distinct coprime number pair. Now, the first number of each pair is simply 1 (since 1 is already assigned), and the second number is the N//i (where // is the floor division operator) as N//i is the number of sabotages at level L. Therefore, the total number of sabotages at level L equals the number of coprime pairs of the form (i, N//i), which equals the number of i in the set {1, 2, 3, ..., N} divided by the number of every i in the set {1, 2, 3, ..., N} multiplied by the number of every N//i in the set {1, 2, 3, ..., N} (because for every i, there are N//i of sabotages at level L).\n\nSo, for a given level L, the number of sabotages at level L equals the sum of the product of every i in the set {1, 2, 3, ..., N} divided by the i and every N//i in the set {1, 2, 3, ..., N} respectively.\n\nSo, the Python code to solve this problem is:\n\n```python\ndef solve(N):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, N + 1):\n        temp = i\n        while temp <= N:\n            count += i * temp\n            temp *= i\n    return count\n\nN = int(input().strip())\nfor _ in range(N):\n    N = int(input().strip())\n    print(solve(N))\n```\n\nPlease note that the above solution might not be efficient, especially for large values of N.
