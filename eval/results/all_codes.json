{"1786": ["The problem you're referring to is a typical example of a programming problem where you are asked to implement a system that can perform certain tasks. In this case, the task is to create a program that calculates the maximum area of glass fragments after each cut. Here's a basic implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef calculate_area(w, h, n, y=None, x=None):\n    sheet = [[0 for _ in range(w)] for _ in range(h)]\n    max_area = 0\n\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        if line[0] == 'H':\n            y = int(line[2:])\n            if y >= h:\n                continue\n            cut_type = 'horizontal'\n            cut_direction = 1\n        else:\n            x = int(line[2:])\n            if x >= w:\n                continue\n            cut_type = 'vertical'\n            cut_direction = -1\n\n        cut_end = y if cut_type == 'horizontal' else x\n        cut_start = cut_end - cut_direction\n\n        for i in range(cut_start, cut_end, cut_direction):\n            sheet[i][x] += 1\n            area = (i+1) * (x+1) - sum(sheet[i][:x])\n            max_area = max(max_area, area)\n\n        print(max_area)\n\nw, h, n = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\ncalculate_area(w, h, n)\n```\n\nIn this program, we first initialize a 2D list to represent the sheet of glass. Then for each line in the input, we determine the type of cut (horizontal or vertical) and the coordinates of the cut. We then calculate the area of each piece of glass that is created by the cut and update the maximum area found so far. After each cut, we print the maximum area found.\n\nThis implementation assumes that there are no overlapping cuts, which is a simplification of the problem. If there are overlapping cuts, a more complex implementation would be needed.\n", "The answer is a Python implementation of the problem, where the program reads the width, height, and number of cuts from the input and calculates the maximum area of the glass fragments after each cut.\n\nHere is a Python code that implements this:\n\n```python\ndef max_area():\n    w, h, n = map(int, input().split())\n    max_area = 0\n    for _ in range(n):\n        d = input()\n        if d[0] == 'H':\n            x = int(d[2:])\n            max_area = max(max_area, x)\n        else:\n            y = int(d[2:])\n            max_area = max(max_area, y)\n    print(max_area)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    max_area()\n```\nThis code first reads the width, height, and number of cuts from the input. It then goes through each cut, checking whether it's a horizontal or vertical cut. If it's a horizontal cut, it calculates the maximum area by taking the maximum of the current maximum area and the distance of the cut (in millimeters). If it's a vertical cut, it calculates the same, but the distance is taken from the left edge of the original glass sheet. The maximum area is then printed after each cut.\n"], "1787": ["This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The approach is to count the number of ways to sort the string s such that for each i (1<=i<=k), s[i] = 'a'. Next, find the number of ways to place 'b' between two sorted 'a's, considering the string s. \n\nTo solve this problem, first, initialize the array dp[i][j] to store the number of ways to sort the first i letters such that the last i letters contains j 'a's. Then, set up the dp table:\n\n- If i = 0 and j = 0, dp[i][j] = 1 because the string is empty.\n- If i = 0, dp[i][j] = 0 because we can't sort the string.\n- If j = 0, dp[i][j] = 1 because we can only sort one 'a' into the string.\n\nThen, fill up the dp table:\n\n- For i >= 1, and j >= 1, dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] because we can't insert 'b' into the current position.\n- For i >= 1, and j >= 1, add the sum of dp[i-1][j-1] and dp[i-1][j] because we can insert 'b' between two sorted 'a'.\n\nFinally, the answer is the sum of the values in the dp[n][k] for 1<=k<=n, modulo 10^9+7, where n is the length of the string s and the sequence of 'a's.\n\nThe Python code for this problem is:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    MOD = 10**9+7\n    N = int(input())\n    s = input()\n    \n    dp = [[0]*27 for _ in range(N+1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1,N+1):\n        for j in range(27):\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]\n            if j >= 1:\n                dp[i][j] += dp[i-1", "This problem can be solved by dynamic programming. The idea is to store the count of possible sequences starting from each position in the string. Initially, we have one possible sequence starting at each position, and for each subsequent position, we add one to the number of sequences that start from the previous position. If we encounter a 'b' at a position where a 'a' was already encountered, we add the count of sequences that start from the 'a' (which is the last position where 'a' was encountered) to the count of sequences that start from the 'b'. We use modulo 10^9 + 7 to prevent integer overflow and print the sum of counts of sequences at the end.\n\nHere is a Python solution for this problem:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    s = input()\n    a = s.find('a')\n    b = s.rfind('b')\n    pre_a, pre_b = a, b\n    res, cur = 1, 0\n    for x in s:\n        if x == 'a':\n            cur += 1\n        else:\n            cur = 0\n        res += cur\n        res %= MOD\n    cur = 0\n    for x in reversed(s[:b]):\n        if x == 'b':\n            cur += 1\n        else:\n            cur = 0\n        res -= cur\n        res %= MOD\n    print(res)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nThis solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string.\n"], "1788": ["Here is a Python program that uses the given constraints to solve for X and Y:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef find_XY(A, B):\n    X = (B + A) // 2\n    Y = (A - B) // 2\n    return X, Y\n\nfor line in sys.stdin:\n    A, B = map(int, line.split())\n    X, Y = find_XY(A, B)\n    print(X, Y)\n```\n\nThis program reads the input lines, then splits each line into the two numbers A and B, and calls the function `find_XY(A, B)` with A and B as arguments, which finds X and Y.
