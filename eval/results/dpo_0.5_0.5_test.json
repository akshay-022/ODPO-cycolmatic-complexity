For each test case, it reads the number of words and their binary representations. It then calculates the reverse of each word and checks if this reverse is in the first `i` words. If it is, it adds the index of this word to the list of reversed words and increments `k`.\n\nIf there are no repeated reverses in the list, it prints -1. If there are repeated reverses, it prints the number of words that can be reversed and the index of these words. If a word cannot be reversed in the first `i` words, it checks the next word.\n\nThis script assumes that the words are provided in the order they appeared in the input. If there are different orders, the script needs to be adjusted accordingly.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n^2), where n is the number of words.

The main idea of the solution is to use the greedy strategy to solve this problem.\n\nThe basic idea is to try to use as much water as possible from the larger barrel first. We can see that the maximum amount of water we can use from any barrel is $\\frac{a_i}{\\text{max}(1, i)}$. This is because we can use all the water from a barrel and move it to the next barrel. So, we should try to use all the water from the most waterfull barrel first. We can use this strategy to reduce the maximum number of water transfers.\n\nThe solution of this problem is implemented in Python:\n\n```python\ndef max_diff(n, k, a):\n    a.sort(reverse=True)\n    for i in range(k):\n        max_value = a[i] / max(1, i)\n        if max_value >= a[i]:\n            a[i] = 0\n        else:\n            a[i] -= max_value\n    return max(a) - min(a)\n\nt = int(input().strip())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n, k = map(int, input().strip().split())\n    a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))\n    print(max_diff(n, k, a))\n```\n\nIn this code, first we sort the array in descending order and for each barrel, we try to use as much water as possible. If the water we can use is more than the initial amount of water, we use all the water from this barrel. Otherwise, we use the water we can use and reduce the initial amount of water.

Therefore, we need to find permutations that don't contain `m/2` as a factor, because if it was a factor, `m` could be at least `m/2 + 1`. We can accomplish this with a simple Python script.\n\nHere's how you could implement this:\n\n```python\nfrom itertools import permutations\n\ndef solve(p):\n    n = len(p)\n    for i in range(1, n//2+1):\n        if n%i == 0 and all(x%i != 0 for x in p):\n            for j in permutations(p, i):\n                for k in permutations(p[n-j[0]:n-i], n-j[0]):\n                    if set(j) == set(k):\n                        return \"1\"*(n-i)+\"0\"*n+\"1\"*i\n    return \"0\"*n\n\nt = int(input().strip())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    p = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))\n    print(solve(p))\n```\n\nThis script reads the test cases and solves them one by one. For each test case, it first checks if a number `m` is beautiful (if `m` cannot be represented as a product of two numbers less than or equal to `m//2`). If it is a beautiful number, it checks all possible permutations that include `m`. If such a permutation is found, it returns \"1\" for the indices where `m` is beautiful and \"0\" for the rest.\n", ""], "5": ["This problem can be solved using a variation of the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT). The formula to solve this problem is: \n\nLet A be an array of the numbers in the first permutation and B be an array of the numbers in the second permutation. \n\nThen, the Chinese Remainder Theorem states that there exists an integer x such that (x \u2261 Ai (mod Li)) for all i, where Li are the lengths of the permutations. We need to calculate the product of all the permutations and then divide the product by the product of the lengths of the permutations to get the x value. \n\nFor example, if we have the lengths 1, 3, 6 for the first permutation, and 1, 2, 3 for the second permutation, and we want to find x such that x mod 1 = 0, x mod 3 = 0, x mod 6 = 0, then we can calculate that x as follows:\n\n1.

However, there is a typo in the question. It mentions \"closing some of the spots\" but it's implied that we should \"close at most 4/7n\" spots. Therefore, the problem statement should be rephrased without changing the requirement of closing spots.\n\nIf we still want to solve this problem, we need to understand how to find the \"closeness\" of the resort to the \"most dangerous\" spots and close spots that are close enough to these spots.
