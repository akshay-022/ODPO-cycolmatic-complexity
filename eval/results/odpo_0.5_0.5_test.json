A topological sort for a graph is a linear ordering of its vertices such that for every directed edge (u, v), vertex u comes before v in the ordering. \n\nIn this case, the words are nodes in the graph, and the condition to start with the last character of the previous word is the edge we want to sort by. The goal is to perform a topological sort and then count the number of words reversed.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef minWordsToReverse(n, words):\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    indegree = defaultdict(int)\n\n    for word in words:\n        for i in range(1, len(word)):\n            graph[word[i]].append(word[i-1])\n            indegree[word[i-1]] += 1\n\n    queue = [node for node in graph if indegree[node] == 0]\n    res = []\n\n    while queue:\n        word = queue.pop(0)\n        res.append(word)\n        for next_word in graph[word]:\n            indegree[next_word] -= 1\n            if indegree[next_word] == 0:\n                queue.append(next_word)\n\n    return len(res), [n.index(w) for w in res] if res else [-1]\n\nt = int(input().strip())\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    words = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n    k, res = minWordsToReverse(n, words)\n    print(k)\n    if res[0] != -1:\n        print(*res)\n    else:\n        print(-1)\n```\n\nThis solution first constructs a graph where the edges are represented by characters in the words. Then it performs a topological sort of the graph to find the sequence of words to be reversed. The resulting sequence is reversed to follow the condition in the problem. If the resulting sequence does not change the number of words to be reversed, it prints -1.
