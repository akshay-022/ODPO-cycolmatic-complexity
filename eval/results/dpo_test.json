{"0": ["This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We can create a dynamic programming array dp of size n+1 and initialize it with -1. For every binary word w in the set of words, we will check its reverse w[::-1] against all previously computed reverses r[i] for i < j where j <= i. If both are different (either dp[i] == -1 or r[i] > dp[j]), we will update dp[i] to be either dp[i] (was not reversed yet) or dp[j]+1 (was reversed and now needs to be reversed again). If w[::-1] is the same as r[i] then we are ok.\n\nHere is the python code for the problem:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    t = int(input().strip())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        words = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]\n        words.append('') # Add an empty string to handle edge cases.\n        r, dp = '', [-1]*n\n        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):\n            dp[i] = max((dp[j] for j in range(i+1, n) if words[i] not in words[j] and words[i][::-1] not in words[j]), default=-1) + 1\n            if dp[i] != -1:\n                r = words[i] + r\n        print(dp[-1] if dp[-1] != -1 else -1)\n        if dp[-1] != -1:\n            print(i+1 for i in range(n) if dp[i] == dp[-1]-1)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nIn the code above, `dp[i]` represents the minimal number of words needed to reverse the set so far, including the `i`-th word. If `i`-th word has not been reversed yet, `dp[i]` is the maximum number of words needed to reverse all the words before `i`, `dp[j]`, where `j` <= `i`", ""], "1": ["The problem is not asking to find the maximum number of diagonal moves, but rather to determine whether or not it is possible to achieve a specific set of coordinates in a certain number of moves. However, as it is not possible to simply say whether it is possible to go to a point in $k_i$ moves without having already made the move, it is not possible to provide an exact solution in a general case. A standard solution to this problem would involve brute force approach. For a single query, you can just check all possible movements from the initial point to the target point and count the number of diagonal moves. However, for many queries, this approach could be very inefficient.\n\nA more efficient solution would be to implement a \"bitboard\" to represent the state of the game. Each cell in the bitboard could be represented as a bit in a long integer. Each bit would represent a possible movement from the current location to the destination location. We could then use a bitwise operation to iterate through all possible combinations of moves, and keep track of the maximum number of moves found. However, the complexity of this approach would be large because there are 8 possible moves for each point, and there are q queries. So the overall time complexity of this solution would be quadratic in the maximum number of moves and points.\n\nThis problem is complex and requires a deep understanding of game theory and bit manipulation. It might be more efficient to approach this problem with a more optimized algorithm or algorithmic complexity reduction method.\n\nAs such, unfortunately, there is no known efficient algorithm for this problem in standard form.\n", ""], "2": ["This problem is a typical example of a variation of the knapsack problem which can be solved efficiently by a 3D dp solution.
