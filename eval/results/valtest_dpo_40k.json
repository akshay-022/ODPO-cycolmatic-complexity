We note that the amount of number that can be divided is the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller one, which can be calculated by taking modulo of the larger number. This modulo can give us the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller one. \n\nLet's write the python code to solve this problem:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n\ndef lcm(a, b):\n    return a * b // gcd(a, b)\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nresult = float('inf')\nfor k in range(a + b + 1):\n    if (a + 2 * k) % (b + 2 * k) == 0:\n        result = min(result, k)\n    if (b + 2 * k) % (a + 2 * k) == 0:\n        result = min(result, k)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nIn this code, `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`, `lcm(a, b)` is the least common multiple of `a` and `b`, and `a|(b+k)` and `b|(a+k)` means that $a|(b+k)$ or $b|(a+k)$.\n\nIn the for loop, if the remainder of `(a + 2 * k)` is zero and `(b + 2 * k)` is not zero, or if `(b + 2 * k)` is zero and `(a + 2 * k)` is not zero, then `k` is a potential result. We then update `result` if we have found a smaller `k`.\n\nThe result is printed at the end.\n", ""], "37": ["In order to solve this problem, we need to consider the following cases:\n\n1.

It compares these to the total finger movements of all numbers with n digits. If it finds a number that has the same finger movements, it prints \"NO\" and ends the program. Otherwise, it prints \"YES\".\n\nThis solution assumes that all numbers are distinct, which is the case in this question, because each digit in the phone number is represented once.\n", ""], "54": ["This problem can be solved by using dynamic programming.

It then iterates over the array, adding the watering time to a running total. If the total time plus the watering time in the next bucket would exceed the garden length `k`, it breaks out of the loop and returns the total time as the minimum number of hours needed.

He slips down at a rate of 1/b cm/hour. The total climbing distance is the sum of the climbing and slipping distances, which is the apple height (h).

The sum of the time spent climbing to the apple and slipping down equals the total height of the caterpillar. \n\nSince the climbing and slipping are not simultaneous, the total time spent is less than 2*t.

CRT states that if $m_i$ are pairwise coprime, the equation $x \\equiv m_1 \\pmod{p_1}$, $x \\equiv m_2 \\pmod{p_2}$, ... , $x \\equiv m_n \\pmod{p_n}$ has at least one solution $x$ in the set $\\{1,2,3,...,p_1, p_2, ..., p_n \\}$.\n\nHere is a python solution that uses the CRT and Fermat's Little Theorem:\n\n```python\ndef solve(a, b, p, x):\n    if a % p == 0:\n        return 0\n    q, r = divmod(p-1, a)\n    m = pow(a, q, p) * b % p\n    if m == 0:\n        m += p\n    s = {m}\n    for i in range(1, r):\n        m = (m - i * p) % p\n        s.add(m)\n    return len(s)\n\nprint(solve(*list(map(int, input().split()))))\n```\n\nIn this code, first we check if $a$ is a factor of $p$. If it is, then there are $x \\equiv 0 \\pmod{p}$ which leads to the CRT not having any solutions, so we return 0.\nThen, we use Fermat's Little Theorem to calculate $m$ where $m = \\left(\\frac{a^{p-1}}{a}\\right) \\times b \\mod{p}$.\nThen we calculate all possible values of $m$ within the range of $p-1$ and $p$ and store them in a set to eliminate duplicate values. We then return the number of unique values in this set.\n", ""], "132": ["You can solve this problem using dynamic programming.\n\nFirstly, sort the digits 2, 3, 5, and 6 in descending order.

After that, it processes each monster one by one, which can be done by checking if the current monster's weight is less than the maximum weight of any other monster in the queue. If it is, it appends the monster to the end of the queue. If not, it tries to find a monster which can eat the current monster. If it can, it eats the other monster and appends the eater to the queue. The eating process repeats until all monsters are eaten. If there is any monster left, it prints \"NO\", else it prints \"YES\" and the sequence of eating monsters.\n", ""], "193": ["To solve this problem, we need to identify if there are any two straight lines (or in this case, any two points) that do not intersect with each other.

It then reads the coordinates and speeds of each taxi, sorts them by their distance to Vasiliy, and computes the total time required to get to Vasiliy by summing the time it takes each taxi to reach its destination. Finally, it prints the minimum time.\n\nThe time complexity is O(n log n), where n is the number of taxis.

Instead, we should consider how to distribute the rooms among their capacities. If each bin has its own capacity (like the capacity of each room), then there are only 4 unique bin configurations, and we can solve this directly.\n\nHowever, as we have the k moves, we can consider the \"state\" of the system at some point and count the number of valid states.

The size of this list can be calculated based on the max capacity of each bin, which is also the max number of people that can be in one room.\n\nFirst, we initialize the list with the number of people in the first bin (0 people in room 1) and the rest of the bins to be empty.

We have i is initially painted white and j is painted black initially, i.e., for all i, j \u2208 {white, black} -> j. \n- Finally, for each i,j \u2208 {white, black} -> {white, black}, where the i is painted white and j is painted black (a condition met), we can add dp[i^j][k] for all 1 \u2264 k < i, which means that for the configuration with bit i=1 set to 1, the path (vertex, vertex) (from k, k) can be extended from the subset of bits in i, which indicates that there is no black edge between k and k' so dp[i^j][k] += dp[i][k], this can be seen from the fact that for the edge (k, k') is black, the only case the i is painted black is when k = k', which is a restriction from the conditions.\n- Finally, dp[2^N - 1][j] will give the number of ways to paint the vertices such that the subset of bits i of binary representation of j is not zero, where all i are painted white initially (indicating that all vertices are connected and no edge between vertices).\n\nThe Python code will look like this:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef main():\n    N = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    edges = [list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(N-1)]\n    M = int(sys.stdin.readline().strip())\n    restrictions = [list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().strip().split())) for _ in range(M)]\n\n    adjacency_matrix = [[0]*N for _ in range(N)]\n    for a, b in edges:\n        adjacency_matrix[a-1][b-1] = 1\n\n    dp = [[0]*2**N for _ in range(2)]\n    dp[0][1] = 2\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n\n    for white in range(1, 2**N):\n        for black in range(2**N):\n            if (white & black) != 0:\n                continue\n            for i in range(N):\n                if (white & 1 << i) != 0:\n                    for j in range(2**N):\n                        if (j & 1 << i) != 0:\n                            continue\n                        dp[(white | j)][j | black] = (dp[(white | j)][j | black] + dp[white][black]*adjacency_matrix[i][N+black]) % 10**9+7\n\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(2**N):\n        satisfies = True\n        for a, b in restrictions:\n            if (i & 1 << a-1) == 0 or (i & 1 << b-1) == 0:\n                satisfies = False\n                break\n        if not satisfies:\n            continue\n        result = (result + dp[i][1] * dp[2**N - 1 - i][0]) % 10**9+7\n\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThe code reads the input and the adjacency matrix is constructed.

For example, if Snuke removes the 'x' at the end of a word, then the pattern will be 'fox', 'fox', 'fox' etc.\n\nLet's assume that we have removed the 'x' at the end of the word 'fox'. Now, we can see that in 'fx', 'fox' has become 'fx', 'fox', and so on. Now, the question is, what is the minimum length of 's' where we have removed 'fox'? \n\nIf we count the number of 'fox' in 's', we can see that it will always be a multiple of 3. Because once a word 'fox' appears, it will always appear as a 'fox', 'fox', and 'fox' (not necessarily in order). This means that there are always multiple of 3 'fox' words in 's'. So, we can just divide 'N' by 3 and multiply it by 3 to get the minimum possible length of s, because in 'fx', 'fox' will appear as 3 times. \n\nThis is a dynamic programming problem. To solve it, we can maintain a DP table where dp[i] will be the minimum possible length of string after i removals by Snuke. \n\nInitially, dp[0]=0 and for dp[1] = len(s) as we can get a string of length 'N' by removing nothing. \n\nFor dp[i] where i>0, dp[i]=min(dp[i], dp[i-1]+N/3)\n\nFor dp[i] where i>1, dp[i]=min(dp[i], dp[i-2]+N/3)\n\nFor i > 2, dp[i]=min(dp[i], dp[i-3]+N/3)\n\nThe reasoning is that we can remove either the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd 'fox' from the string and compare the number of 'fox' in the resulting string with N/3. \n\nThe time complexity of this approach is O(N) as we are iterating through all elements in the string. \n\nSo, the minimum possible length of s after some number of operations by Snuke is: \n\nlen(s) mod 3 if len(s) is multiple of 3 else, \n\n1 if len(s) is 1, \n\n2 if len(s) is 2.\n", ""], "456": ["This problem can be solved by using a technique called dynamic programming.\n\nFirstly, understand that the friend will have an advantage in every pair.

Use a dynamic programming (DP) array dp to keep track of the minimum cost for each boxer. The idea is that the friend will have a better chance to win the tournament, so the minimum cost for the friend should be smaller than the minimum cost for other boxers. \n\nFor a particular boxer, you can make the following decisions:\n\n1.

Because one pile has zero stones while the other pile has Ai stones, Aoki can win if he moves the first pile, which is less than half of the total number of stones Ai.

Then, we need to solve this equation to get the price for buying one kilo of apple from a specific supermarket. \n\nAfter obtaining the price for one kilo of apple from a specific supermarket, we can multiply it by the number of kilos to get the cost for buying the specified number of apples. \n\nIn the last step, we add up all these costs to get the total cost for buying the specified number of apples.\n\nBy using this method, we can find the minimum cost for buying m kilos of apples.

Then, it reads the types of utensils. The utensils are sorted, and for each set of utensils, it checks if it is larger than the previous one by 1. If it is, it increments the count.

Then we iterate through the array and we add the current element to the deque. If the deque length is less than `c`, we add the next element; otherwise, we remove the first element from the deque until the length is equal to `c`. The total sum of the elements in the deque `dq` and the sum `current_sum` form a possible partition. If the current sum is smaller than `min_sum`, we update `min_sum` with `current_sum`.\n\nThe time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) due to the nested loop, where n is the size of the array. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the array and the deque.\n", ""], "522": ["The approach to this problem can be solved by sorting the points and then calculating the difference between consecutive points.\n\nIf there is any difference in the distances, you can add points in the middle between the two points which will make the difference equal to the difference between consecutive points.\n\nHere is a Python program that solves the problem:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    x = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    x.sort()\n    res = 0\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        res += x[i-1] - x[i]\n    print(res)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nIn this program, `n` is the number of points and `x` is a list of coordinates. The list `x` is first sorted, and then for each point `i` (from `1` to `n-1`), we subtract the current point `x[i]` from the next point `x[i-1]` and add the result to `res` (which initially is `0`). Finally, we print `res`.\n\nFor example, for the input `3`, `[-5, 10, 5]`, the sorted list `[-5, -5, 10]` is `[10, 5]`. So, `res` is `10 - 5 = 5`.\n\nThe time complexity of this program is `O(n log n)`.\n", ""], "523": ["This problem is a variant of the optimal binary search problem.

We create two lists, `dp` and `val` to keep track of the maximum total value we can get with the available time and the total value with the available time. We iterate over the items in reverse order and update the `dp` and `val` lists accordingly. The maximum total value and the number of items saved can be found in the `dp` and `val` lists, respectively. We then print the maximum possible total value, the number of items saved, and the numbers of the saved items in order.\n", ""]}
