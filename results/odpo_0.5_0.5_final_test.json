After that, it loops through the string, checks if the first character of the two strings at the current indices is the same and the splitting of the first part of the strings at the first character forms a valid binary tree.

This problem can be solved using a sliding window technique with a greedy approach. We will keep a count of the characters in T that have not yet been encountered or are yet to be covered, and also a counter for the total number of unique characters in T.

We will start sliding the right pointer towards the right and continually move the left pointer until the window contains all of the characters in T. Once this happens, we will keep track of the minimum substring we have seen so far and slide the left pointer to the right to make the window smaller and continue this until we have tried every character in S.\n\nHere is a Python solution using this method:\n\n```python\ndef minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:\n    from collections import Counter\n    if not t or not s: return \"\"\n    \n    t_len = len(t)\n    s_len = len(s)\n    left, right = 0, 0\n    counter, missing = Counter(t), t_len\n    min_len = float('inf'), None\n    \n    while right < s_len:\n        if counter[s[right]] > 0:\n            missing -= 1\n        counter[s[right]] -= 1\n        right += 1\n        \n        while missing == 0:\n            if right - left + 1 < min_len:\n                min_len = right - left + 1\n                min_sub = s[left:right + 1]\n            \n            counter[s[left]] += 1\n            if counter[s[left]] > 0:\n                missing += 1\n            left += 1\n            \n    return min_sub\n```\n\nYou can use this solution to solve this problem.

We will first call the method with all the piles, then we will call the method with two piles from the two sides and then we will call the method with three piles.\n\nIn this strategy, we will use the following conditions to decide which piles to take:\n- Pick the pile if it has the maximum number of coins among the three piles in the middle. If multiple piles have the same maximum coins, choose the one with the larger index.\n- Alice will pick the pile with maximum coins when\u5979 comes here and Bob will pick the pile with minimum coins when he comes here.\n\nThe Python implementation for this approach is as follows:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\nclass Solution:\n    def maxCoins(self, piles: List[int]) -> int:\n        piles.sort()\n        i = -1\n        res = 0\n        while len(piles) > 2:\n            i += 2\n            res += piles[i]\n            piles.pop(i+1)\n        return res\n```\n\nIn the function, we first sort the piles list.

If Alice picks the maximum piles, then Bob will pick the one with the least piles as he wants the coins as maximum as possible.\n\nThen, we iterate till we have more than 2 piles. Since Alice always has the largest pile, we always pick the pile with the maximum number of coins in the middle.\n\nThe time complexity is O(nlogn) due to the sorting operation, where n is the length of the piles.

We start by setting the left and right pointer to the smallest and the largest number in the array respectively. After each iteration of the while loop, we calculate the middle number as the divisor and check if the sum of the divisions with this divisor is less than or equal to the threshold. If it is, we adjust the right pointer to the middle - 1 to find the smallest divisor. If it isn't, we adjust the left pointer to the middle + 1.

The number of positive differences, \n2. The number of negative differences.\n\nWe also need to handle the case where there's zero difference between numbers, which means the whole number sequence could be a wiggle sequence. \n\nHowever, due to the time complexity limitation of O(n), the actual solution can't run within a few seconds. \n\nHere is the Python solution that uses these insights to solve the problem in O(n) time complexity:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def wiggleMaxLength(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n        if len(nums) < 2:\n            return len(nums)\n        \n        up = down = prev_diff = 1\n        for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n            diff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1]\n            if diff != 0:\n                if diff > 0 and diff != prev_diff:\n                    up = down + 1\n                    prev_diff = diff\n                elif diff < 0 and diff != prev_diff:\n                    down = up + 1\n                    prev_diff = diff\n                elif diff == 0:\n                    prev_diff = diff\n        return max(up, down)\n```\n\nIn this solution, we iterate over the numbers in the list. If the differences between each number and the previous one are different, we consider the current difference as an increase or decrease in the sequence. We then update our count based on whether the difference increases or decreases.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the above solution may return incorrect results for cases like [1,1,1], where the expected result is 2, but the actual result is 1.

If `max_seen` is equal to the current moment `i`, it means all the previous bulbs have been turned on and are blue, so we increment `count` and add `count` to `res`.\n\nFinally, we return `res`, which represents the total number of moments when all turned on bulbs are blue.\n", ""], "278": ["Here is a Python solution for the problem using the principles of Call-Based programming.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def largestMultipleOfThree(self, digits: List[int]) -> str:\n        \n        # Apply call-based solution\n        # Divide the digits into three groups:\n        # - nums1: digits that sum up to the maximum value (3, 6 or 9)\n        # - nums2: digits that sum up to the second maximum value (3, 6 or 9)\n        # - nums3: digits that sum up to the third maximum value (3, 6 or 9)\n        # Then find the largest numbers in each group and concatenate them together\n        nums1, nums2, nums3 = [], [], []\n\n        for digit in sorted(digits, reverse=True):\n            if digit % 3 == 0:\n                nums1.append(digit)\n            elif digit % 3 == 1:\n                nums2.append(digit)\n            else:\n                nums3.append(digit)\n        \n        # Replace leading zeros\n        nums1 = [str(num) for num in nums1]\n        nums2 = [str(num) for num in nums2]\n        nums3 = [str(num) for num in nums3]\n        \n        # If nums1 is empty, we know the numbers cannot be divided by 3, \n        # so return empty string\n        if not nums1:\n            return ''\n        \n        # Else concatenate all numbers in nums1, nums2, and nums3\n        res = nums1[0] + nums2[0] + nums3[0]\n\n        # If the result contains '0', it means it does not start with '0', \n        # so make it '0'\n        if res[0] == '0':\n            return '0'\n\n        return ''.join(sorted(res, reverse=True))\n```\n\nThis algorithm works by using call-based solution by dividing the problem into several smaller sub-problems (groups of digits) and combining the solutions of these", ""], "279": ["def getPermutation(self, n: int, k: int) -> str:\n    nums = [str(i) for i in range(1, n+1)]\n    fact = [1]\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        fact.append(fact[-1]*i)\n    k -= 1\n    res = []\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        idx = k//fact[i-1]\n        k %= fact[i-1]\n        res.append(nums.pop(idx))\n    return ''.join(res)\n", ""], "280": ["def palindromePartition(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:\n    n = len(s)\n    dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    for l in range(n):\n        for j in range(l, n):\n            i = j-l\n            if l == 0:\n                dp[i][j] = 0\n            elif l == 1:\n                dp[i][j] = 1 if s[i] == s[j] else 2\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 2 if s[i] == s[j] else dp[i+1][j-1] + 1\n\n    cost = [[0]*n for _ in range(n)]\n    for l in range(1, n):\n        for i in range(n-l):\n            j = i+l\n            cost[i][j] = min([dp[i][k]+dp[k+1][j] for k in range(i, j+1)])\n\n    return cost[0][n-1]\n", ""], "281": ["Here is the Python solution.\n\nThis solution works by keeping count of characters in 's' and 't' which needs to be converted into 't'.

The `left` and `right` pointers are initialized to the maximum weight and the sum of the weights, respectively. Then, in each iteration of the binary search, it calculates the mid value, and checks if it's possible to ship all the packages within D days using a ship capacity of mid. If it is, it updates `right` to mid; otherwise, it updates `left` to mid + 1.

This approach avoids the repeated subtraction for larger dividends and uses a bitwise shift to repeatedly subtract the divisor while the dividend is still positive. \n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that the solution doesn't check if the quotient will overflow, which can be handled by the Python interpreter or by considering the maximum integer value as the limit case when the result goes above it.

This limitation ensures the computation doesn't go beyond the available time. The code first counts the digits in the number N and then checks whether the counts of the digits in N are divisible by any of the powers of 2 up to 30. The powers of 2 are checked because a digit can only appear in the first place (i.e., 0), and there are only 31 numbers between 1 and 30 that start with a digit other than 0, each of which has fewer than 10 digits.\n\nFor example:\n\n- N=10, the function will return True, because the counts of digits in the number and its next highest power of 2 are the same, i.e., `[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` and `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]`.\n- N=24, the function will return False, because the counts of digits in the number and its next highest power of 2 are not the same, i.e., `[0", ""], "427": ["Here is a Python solution using a modified form of the partition function called partition:\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def countOrders(self, n: int) -> int:\n        mod = 10**9 + 7\n        ans = 1\n        for i in range(2, 2*n+1, 2):\n            # Calculate number of valid permutations\n            ans = ans * i\n            ans = ans * (i-1) // 2\n            # Apply modulo operation\n            ans = ans % mod\n        return ans\n```\n\nIn this code, we have a loop that iterates over the numbers 2 to 2n, doubling each iteration (since we must choose an odd number of pickups and deliveries for each pair). \n\nThe variable `ans` is used to store the current total number of valid permutations. \n\nFor each number in the range, we first calculate `ans` by multiplying `ans` with the current number. The reason behind this is that the number of valid permutations is dependent on the previous number, so we need to apply the previous number (i-1) to it to remove the duplicated items.\n\nThe next step is to apply modulo operation as it is required in the question.\n\nThis code assumes that the number of pickups and deliveries for each pair is the same, so the number of valid permutations is equal to the number of pickups. If the number of pickups and deliveries for each pair is different, then the number of valid permutations will be the product of the number of pickups and the number of deliveries, which requires the partition function.\n\nNote: The partition function is also required to calculate the number of permutations for each valid set of pickups and deliveries. This code calculates the partition function by hand, as it's straightforward. The partition function is the number of ways to partition a set into two non-empty groups, or more generally, into `k` non-empty groups. It is the product of (i-1) for `k` and the number of permutations of the `i-1`-element set.\n\nRemember, this function can become slow for large inputs due to the recursive nature of the calculation.

For each tuple, if the start point is larger than the end point, it means the interval doesn't overlap with anything, and we add the height to the maximum number of sticks. If the start point is larger than the end point, it means the interval overlaps with something, so we add the length of the interval to the maximum number of sticks and update the end point.

This is because the teacher said that binary search algorithm won't work if the array was not sorted.\n\nGiven that the teacher was kind, he chose the first element of the array as the pivot for the binary search and then recursively dividing the problem into two sub-problems based on the pivot position. If the pivot is greater than the X, the algorithm would continue in the left part of the array. If the pivot is smaller, it would continue in the right part of the array.\n\nChef had to make multiple attempts to sort the array with binary search and he got lucky with the teacher. He remembered that if a student's answer was incorrect, he would swap the elements to make it correct. This makes him more confident about his ability to get to the right answer if the student's answer is wrong.\n\nIn the end, Chef found a function for finding a specific value in an array using a binary search algorithm, but he noticed that the teacher was giving a task with an array that only had certain values.

Once I understand how to navigate this system, I can then figure out how to add the functionality of summing values between given numbers.\n\n3.

Here, the state to reach is the sum of the elements of the array so far, and the constraints are the maximum value of the elements in the array less than or equal to M and the number of elements to choose.\n\nTo solve this problem, we will use dynamic programming. We will create a 2-D array dp where dp[i][j] will be the number of ways to get the sum i from the first j elements of the array. Initially, dp[0][0] = 1 and dp[i][0] = 0 for all i >= 1.

The inner loops update the dp table by adding the number of ways to reach the current sum from the previous elements. Finally, the result is dp[K][M], the number of different final arrays after playing the game.\n\nThis approach works because dp[i][j] is only dependent on dp[i][j - 1] (i.e., we can just add the previous element to get to the current sum) and dp[i -", ""], "682": ["I'm sorry but the problem you've posed is not clear.

Dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest path in a graph, which in this case would serve as an optimization strategy.\n\nFirstly, the cost of direct flights between all cities are represented by an array of length C.\n\nThe cost of a sequence of connecting flights is then calculated by summing up the costs of direct flights along the route. This is done using a priority queue to select the cheapest connecting flight first, where each flight is an element in the priority queue.\n\nTo calculate the shortest path in the network, we initialize an array `dist[]` of length C with the maximum possible integer value. The `dist[i]` value represents the minimum cost to travel from the source city to city `i` using only direct flights.\n\nAfter populating the `dist[]` array, Dijkstra's algorithm is implemented. The algorithm starts from the source city and relaxes the edges of the graph, updating the `dist` array whenever a shorter path is found. The `dist[i]` value is updated whenever a direct flight from city `i` has a cheaper path.\n\nFinally, the maximum value in `dist[]` is the maximum value among the cheapest routes in the network.\n\nThis approach ensures that the cost is maximized and all pairs of cities are connected, as per the problem statement.\n", ""], "732": ["ALGORITHM:\n1.

The key to solving this problem is to realize that for any graph to satisfy the conditions, it is sufficient to sort the edge weights in descending order, and then for every adjacent pair, the weight of the shortest path between the two vertices should be equal to the weight of the longest path that uses only two vertices. This is due to the fact that any vertex $i$ with the largest weight ($A_i$) can never form a cycle with a smaller weight, so its smallest path can never have weight $< A_i$.\n\nSince there are $N-1$ edges, and the $i$th edge has weight $A_i$, there can be at most $N$ vertices with weight $A_i$. This corresponds to the maximum possible number of vertices in a cycle of weight $A_i$. The total number of cycles will be $\\frac{N(N-1)}{2}$, which can be calculated as $\\frac{N(N-1)}{2} = \\frac{(N-1)*(N-2)}{2}$.

The largest LCM can be the sum of LCM of two numbers, as for larger numbers, we cannot use larger numbers (we can take them in pairs). However, we need to find maximum of these two possibilities.\n\nThe key observation here is, the maximum number we can obtain using three numbers will never be greater than 2N (or less than N in the first step). Because if it is greater than 2N, then we can take larger pair of numbers, which is not feasible because the numbers are not distinct and less than N. Also, it is safe because the numbers are the largest possible, so their LCM must be smaller than 2N.\n\nSo the maximum possible LCM of three distinct numbers from 1 to N is at most 2N.\n\nSo, we just need to calculate 2N as per above approach.\n\nIn the python code:\n\ndef find_lcm(N):\n    if N <= 1:\n        return N\n    total = 1\n    for i in range(2, N + 1):\n        if i * i <= N:\n            if total < i:\n                total *= i\n            else:\n                total *= i * (N // i)\n    return total\n\nT = int(input())\n\nfor _ in range(T):\n    N = int(input())\n    print(find_lcm(2 * N))\n\nThis python function will take O(n) time complexity to calculate and output the result.\n", ""], "809": ["The problem can be solved by applying the Pythagorean Theorem.

We maintain a dynamic programming array dp of size N+1 where dp[i] is the maximum score that can be obtained by jumping from square i to square N. \n\nAt each step, if we are in the forward phase, we can jump from square i to square i+1 or i+2 (if 1<=i+1 or i+2<=N).

One of the ways to solve this problem is to observe that every 2 repetitions of the substring \"ab\" forms a new substring \"ab\" of twice as long. This observation allows us to count the number of occurrences of \"ab\" in the new string in O(n) time.\n\nFirst, observe that the substring \"ab\" is repeated K times. Since the string contains exactly K repetitions of the substring \"ab\", the total length of the string is K * 2.\n\nThen, observe that for every pair of characters in the string, if they are 'a' and 'b', there are (K - 1) such pairs where the second character is 'b' and the first character is 'a'. This is because, if the second character is 'b' and the first character is 'a', the sequence 'ab' must be the first 'k-1' occurrences of 'ab' in the new string.\n\nTherefore, the number of subsequences of length 2 in the string is proportional to the number of (K - 1) 'ab' pairs. This property is extended to larger sequences by noting that every K-th character gives us one new pair 'ab' (it has to be 'a' and 'b'), and for every other character give us two new pairs 'ab' (because it is 'a' and 'b'), and so on.\n\nNow, to find out the number of subsequences of length 2 in the new string, simply multiply the number of 'a's in the string by the number of 'b's in the string.\n\nThe Python code to implement this logic is as follows:\n\n```python\ndef solve(N, K, S):\n    # count number of 'a's and 'b's\n    a = s.count('a')\n    b = s.count('b')\n    # return number of subsequences of length 2\n    return min(a, b) * min(K-1, a-1)\n\nt = int(input().strip())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    N, K = map(int, input().strip().split())\n    s = input().strip()\n    print(solve(N, K", ""], "828": ["The problem can be solved by maintaining an array of unpaid maintenance fees. \n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nt = int(input().strip())\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    a = [int(x) for x in input().strip().split(' ')]\n    fines = [0]*n\n    unpaid_fees = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        if a[i] == 1:\n            unpaid_fees += 100\n        else:\n            fines[i] = 100\n    total = unpaid_fees + sum(fines)\n    print(total)\n```\n\nIn the above Python program:\n- We first read the number of test cases T.\n- For each test case:\n  - We read the number of months and maintenance fees.\n  - We create an array a to store whether we have paid the fees or not.\n  - We initialize a variable unpaid_fees to keep track of the unpaid fees.\n  - We loop through the months and if the fees have been paid, we add 100 to unpaid_fees, otherwise, we add 100 to fines array.\n  - Finally, we print the total due including fines.\n", ""], "829": ["This problem is a combination of some data structures and algorithms.

In python, the modulo operator is represented by %.\n\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nT = int(input().strip())\nfor t in range(T):\n    K = int(input().strip())\n    position = 1\n    count = 0\n    while count < K:\n        position = (position + 1) % 2\n        if position == 1:\n            count += 1\n    print(position)\n```\n\nThis Python code reads the number of test cases, and for each test case, it calculates the position of the last laddu in the row using the `while` loop and the condition `count < K`. The loop counts the number of laddus selected by each customer and increases the position by 1 when the position is 1 (customer is selected) and then takes the modulo 2 of the position. The position of the last laddu is then printed.\n", ""], "859": ["The problem is a variant of XOR permutations. The XOR operation on two bits gives a 1 if the bits are different and 0 if they are the same. Given a number x, its XOR operation with 1 gives us an operation which can be performed on a permutation.

However, here we are looking at a specific arrangement (bitwise XOR operation) rather than just a number.\n\nFor the given problem, the requirement is to find the K-th highest number after performing the XOR operation on all numbers from 1 to N.

We then calculate K as K = N - K + 1 because the XOR operation has to be performed on Kth bit not the Kth number (we are starting from zero).\n4. We then print K.\n5. This process is repeated for T test cases.\n\nThis code works for the valid constraints. If the input is not valid (e.g., N<1 or K>N), it prints -1 as asked in the problem.

We use while loop to remove the digit d from the end of N. If N becomes 0, it means that the number cannot be reduced further and we print 0 as the answer.

Iterate over the array and for each index i, update prefix[i] as the number of subarrays ending at i and having unique elements.\n4.

The length of the longest suffix can be found in a single pass of the prefix array from the right.\n\nThe time complexity for the solution is O(n log n) because of sorting the array and O(n) for the prefix array.

This is because for every non-equal pair of numbers, it subtracts the smaller number from the larger number and replaces the larger number with the result. The sequence is not allowed to have any values occurring twice, as that would result in equal values among numbers. \n\nAs per the given problem, Chef has provided the sequence and a corresponding sequence of pairs.

This can give us an optimal strategy to maximize the number of friends who can join the party.\n\nHere is a Python solution:\n\n```python\nimport sys\n\ndef update(tree, n, idx, val):\n    while idx <= n:\n        tree[idx] += val\n        idx += idx & -idx\n\ndef query(tree, idx):\n    res = 0\n    while idx > 0:\n        res += tree[idx]\n        idx -= idx & -idx\n    return res\n\ndef solve():\n    t = int(input().strip())\n    for _ in range(t):\n        n = int(input().strip())\n        a = list(map(int, input().strip().split()))\n        prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)\n        max_participants = 0\n        for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n            max_participants = max(max_participants, query(prefix_sum, a[i] - 1))\n            update(prefix_sum, a[i], a[i] + 1, 1)\n        print(max_participants)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nThis solution works in O(n log n) time complexity, which is sufficient for the given constraints. The main idea is to keep track of the largest number of people who joined the party until each position in the array while updating the tree accordingly. The maximum number of friends who can join the party is initially 0, and after each friend joins, it is updated to be the max of the current maximum and the current number of people joined. Finally, it prints the maximum number of friends who can join the party.\n", ""], "1179": ["This problem is a variant of the \"minimum swaps\" problem in the \"Google Coding Jam\" competition (https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/jam/).

If the sums are equal, it means that we can swap elements in such way.

The collision happens when the angle of incidence and the angle of reflection are equal and zero friction loss occurs. The point of collision can be calculated by applying the equation of circular motion, where v is the velocity and r is the radius of the circle.\n\nThe equation of motion for the ball in circular motion is given by the equation:\n\nr*v*cos(\u03b8) = p\n\nWhere r is the radius of the circle, v is the velocity, and \u03b8 is the angle of incidence. Substituting the values given in the problem, the equation reduces to:\n\nr*v*cos(45) = p\n\nThe angle of reflection occurs when the ball hits the sides of the circle. In the given problem, we know that when the ball hits the sides, it will not move further, but we are only interested in the point of collision, not the relative motion of the ball after the collision. So we can set \u03b8 = 45 as the angle of incidence, and p = v as the constant of projection.\n\nSo, we need to find the value of v, which is the speed of the ball when the ball hits the sides. We can do this by setting p = 2v (since the ball stops when it hits the sides, so the velocity of the ball is half the initial velocity). \n\nThe equation then becomes:\n\nv = 2p/r*cos(45)\n\nThis equation can be simplified further, but it gives an easy answer. If we let p = 2v, we get:\n\nv = 2*(2p)/r*cos(45) = p*cos(45/2)\n\nFrom here, we can substitute v back to get p, then use that to find the coordinates of the collision:\n\np = r*v*cos(45/2)\n\nSo, the answer is the point of collision (x, y) which is (p, p*cos(45/2)).\n\nThis solution works because the angles of reflection are equal to each other and the ball hits the sides with zero frictional loss, so the speed is constant after hitting the sides.\n\nNow, let's implement this solution in Python.\n\n```python\ndef collision_point(N,", ""], "1181": ["## Algorithm:\n### Step 1: \nTake a number 'N' as input.\n\n### Step 2:\nConvert 'N' into a string. \n\n### Step 3:\nCalculate the sum of its digits. \n\n### Step 4:\nIf 'N' is divisible by the sum of its digits, print \"Yes\", otherwise print \"No\". \n\n## Python Code:\n```python\ndef check(n):\n    digit_sum = sum(int(i) for i in str(n))\n    if n % digit_sum == 0:\n        print(\"Yes\")\n    else:\n        print(\"No\")\n\nt = int(input().strip())\n\nfor _ in range(t):\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    check(n)\n```\n\n## Explanation:\nThe task asks us to write a program that, given an integer 'N', checks if 'N' is divisible by the sum of its digits.

The program will then print 'Yes' if 'N' is divisible by the sum of its digits, and 'No' otherwise.

We can solve this by brute force as the solution will be the smallest A where A + A/M is equal to M.\n\nSince M is an integer, A+A/M will always be less than M. Therefore, we can iterate from 1 to sqrt(M) and check if the sum of A and their half is equal to M. If it is, then we add A to our answer list.\n\nHere is a Python code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nimport math\n\nT = int(input().strip())\nfor i in range(T):\n    M = int(input().strip())\n    result = []\n    for A in range(1, int(math.sqrt(M)) + 1):\n        if M % A == 0:\n            B = M // A\n            if A + B == A*B // M:\n                result.append(A)\n    print(len(result))\n    for num in sorted(result):\n        print(num)\n```\n\nThis code first reads the number of test cases T. For each test case, it reads M, finds all A from 1 to sqrt(M) which are divisible by M, and checks if A + A/M = M. If it is, it adds A to the result list.

The bank accepts these coins and they will be denominated in a way so that, no other coin of denomination can sum up to it. In this case, the minimum number of coins to make $1+2=3$ and the sum of these coins will be $3$.\n\nHowever, the problem statement clearly states that the bank accepts coins in such a way that the denomination of a coin cannot be formed by summing any two coins previously accepted, and the denomination of the bank must include at least one coin that allows the sum to be represented by any coin less than it. \n\nIn other words, if the first coin is $1$, the bank cannot accept another $1$ or any coin that can represent $2$. If the first two coins are $1$ and $2$, the bank cannot accept a $3$ or any coin that can represent $4$. \n\nSo for $N$ coins, the bank would need to keep all the denominations for $1$, $2$, $4$, $8$, and so on up to $N$, and the total sum would be $2^{N} - 1$. \n\nThe solution to this problem involves dynamic programming and combinatorics.

This can be done by trying all possible combinations and choosing the one that gives the least number of coins. \n\nThis is an optimization problem that can be solved by dynamic programming.

However, this problem is more complex than a standard A* because we need to consider all the possible positions for the mouses as well as the Little Elephant.\n\nIn this problem, A* is used with an additional constraint that the Little Elephant's afraid positions are the source vertices.

For each mouse, we calculate the path from Little Elephant to that mouse if the mouse is afraid of Little Elephant. In this path, if the mouse is afraid, it cannot be reached from the Little Elephant.\n\nOnce we have all the paths from Little Elephant to all mouses, we select the path with the least number of moves that have the Little Elephant afraid.\n\nThis solution has a complexity of O(n*m*2^(n+m)) where n, m are the number of rows and columns in the board.

Then, add the city to the visited array and the priority queue.\n4. For each neighbor city, if it has not been visited yet, go to step 2. Otherwise, just continue to the next city.\n5. Repeat the process until the priority queue is empty or all cities have been visited.\n\nIn the priority queue, a city is chosen first if and only if the city has been visited before by a higher-value city.

Then, dp[i] stores the number of ways to form i using the different powers of integers. \n\nSecondly, you initialize dp[0] to 1 because the number of ways to form 0 using an integer is 1.

The player who can't move (who will go first) buys the food from the loser. The first player to go to an even round wins.

This is because the sum can get very large quickly and the actual time required for this computation is considerable.\n\nGiven the large number of digits and weights (from 1 to 300), a brute force solution might be too slow. A good strategy here is to think in terms of the sums of subsets and count the numbers with a particular sum, then scale it according to the number of digits. This allows us to calculate the number of subsets and then scale it according to the number of digits.\n\nAs a programming solution, one approach could be implementing these ideas.\n\nGiven N and W, we can represent the weights as a number with 'w' bits, where each bit is of value 1 if the corresponding digit falls into the subset of {1, 2, ..., 9} and 0 otherwise. The number of such numbers is C(2^w, 2^N). To sum up the weights, we use the binomial coefficients C(x, n).\n\nThen, to count the numbers with certain sums, we iterate through the subsets of {1, 2, ..., 9} and for each subset, we calculate the corresponding binomial coefficient C(x, w), which represents the count of numbers with weight 'w' for 'x' digits.\n\nFinally, we multiply these counts by 2^(300 - N) and mod it by 10^9+7 to get the final answer. \n\nThis approach, although technically correct, would require significantly more computations than if we simply brute force the problem.

It can be solved using dynamic programming. Here, we are interested in the number of ways to fill a knapsack (which in this case is a rectangle) with rectangles of increasing areas.\n\nThe dynamic programming approach to solve this problem is as follows:\n\n1. Initialize an array `dp` of size `(N+1) x (N+1)` where `dp[i][j]` is the number of ways to fill a rectangle of area `j` using `i` rectangular cells. `dp[i][j]` is initialized with `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`, as we can't fill any rectangle with more cells than the one we have left.\n\n2. For each remaining cell `i`, if `i` is greater than or equal to `k`, where `k` is the remaining length of the row, we can extend the previous row and `dp[i][j] += dp[k][j-1]`, because we can extend the current row and `j-1` columns in the way we have done before.\n\n3. Finally, the answer is `dp[N][N]`.\n\nThe time complexity of this algorithm is `O(N^2)`, and the space complexity is `O(N^2)`. The runtime and space complexity of this algorithm are directly proportional to the size of the input.\n\nThis problem could be very tricky to solve for large input sizes, but it's possible to solve it using dynamic programming and some optimizations. The idea is to store the number of ways to fill a row `j` of cells, and the number of ways to fill a row `j` of cells, and the number of ways to fill a row `j` of cells minus one. This way, we can just add the two stored values to get the number of ways to fill a row `j` of cells. This will reduce the time complexity from `O(2^N)` to `O(N)`. This method is often used to solve combinatoric problems. \n\nIn this question, since the input size is quite large (up to 10^10), we need a method", ""], "1395": ["The logic behind the solution is based on the modulus property which states that (a+b) % p = (a % p + b % p) % p.

For the student with roll number 2, if it's their turn to prepare the exam, they will get the same set (if they are assigned to student with roll number 3) or student with roll number 1's set (if they are assigned to a student with roll number 4). Both students will cheat.\n\nTherefore, to find out how many pairs of students can cheat, we just need to find out the pairs which remain same after a modulo operation is performed. To find that, we can observe that the number of students who can cheat will be equal to $(a - b) \\% p$ for any two students who can cheat.\n\nThe solution in Python language is as follows:\n\n```python\nT = int(input().strip())\n\nfor _ in range(T):\n    A, B = map(int, input().strip().split())\n    B -= A \n    B %= len(range(1, 10**8 + 1))\n    if B == 0:\n        print(\"-1\")\n    else:\n        print(B)\n```\n\nThe time complexity is O(1) since the input does not change with the input size, and the space complexity is also O(1) because the space required does not change with the input size. \n\nLet's say there are `x` pairs who can cheat.

First, you need to observe that when Chef selects x_i, he has an opportunity to earn maximum score by popping the bottom x_i numbers from the stack. \n\n2.

After finding x_i, you need to check if Chef can select x_i from S and pop the bottom x_i numbers from the stack, without losing any score.\n\n4. If Chef can make such move, he has a chance to win.

The time complexity of this solution is O(N log N) where N is the length of the string.\n\nThe program is designed to handle a range of test cases.

We update the prefix sum to include both A[i] and A[j] (if A[j] > A[i]).\n\nAfter this, the longest size of subsequence is simply the number of elements in the array that have a prefix sum.\n\nHere is the Python code for this approach:\n\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input().strip())\n    A = sorted(map(int, input().strip().split()))\n    prefix_sum = [0]*(n+1)\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] ^ A[i-1]\n    lis = [A[0]]\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if prefix_sum[i] > lis[-1]:\n            lis.append(prefix_sum[i])\n        else:\n            j = bisect.bisect_right(lis, prefix_sum[i])\n            lis[j] = prefix_sum[i]\n    return len(lis)\n\nprint(solve())\n```\n\nThis code reads the input and outputs the longest size of subsequence with the given property.\n", ""], "1521": ["This problem can be solved using the concept of binary indexed tree or segment tree and Union-find data structure.
